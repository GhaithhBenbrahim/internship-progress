# Multi-Page Application - TouchGFX

This project demonstrates how to build a multi-screen (multi-page) application using **TouchGFX Designer** and **STM32CubeIDE**.

---

## Project Overview

- Implements multiple screens with navigation between them.
- Shows how to manage different UI views and transitions in TouchGFX.
- Uses buttons to switch between screens.
- Designed and generated with TouchGFX Designer, built with STM32CubeIDE.

---

## Features

- Multiple distinct screens/pages.
- Screen navigation with buttons.
- Clean separation of UI logic for each screen.
- Efficient use of TouchGFX framework for embedded GUIs.

---

## How It Works

- Each screen is implemented as a separate view.
- Buttons trigger callbacks to switch between screens.
- TouchGFX Designer manages screen transitions and navigation.
- The application handles state management and screen updates.

## Build and Run

1. Open the project in **STM32CubeIDE**.
2. Generate the code using **TouchGFX Designer**.
3. Build and flash the firmware to your STM32 board or run the TouchGFX Simulator.
4. Use the UI buttons to navigate between different screens.
